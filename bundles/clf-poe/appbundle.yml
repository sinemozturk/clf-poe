    ### ⚓ Clf POE

    The **Clf POE** application serves as a centralized file intake system for processing requisitions in a structured pipeline. 
    It allows users to upload, track, and categorize files through various workflow states such as Awaiting Processing, In Process, Sourced, and Rejected. 
    The interface mimics real-time dashboard behavior and supports batch pagination for large input volumes, while maintaining a formal and government-ready UI design for internal teams.
